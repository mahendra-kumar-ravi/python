Practice Questions Using Pandas & NumPy
ðŸ”¹ Basic Exploration
Show the first 10 rows of the dataset.

Get the shape, column names, and data types.

Count the number of missing values in each column.

Get the number of passengers who survived vs. didnâ€™t survive.

Find the average age of passengers.

ðŸ”¹ Filtering & Conditional Selection
Display all passengers who are male and under 18 years old.

Find passengers who paid more than $100 and were in 1st class.

Select all rows where age is missing.

ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering
Create a new column called FamilySize = SibSp + Parch.

Create a new column that categorizes fare into bins (low, medium, high).

Create a new column is_child that is True if age < 18.

ðŸ”¹ Grouping & Aggregation
Find the survival rate for each passenger class (Pclass).

Group by Sex and calculate the average fare and age.

Count how many passengers survived from each embarkation port (Embarked).

ðŸ”¹ NumPy-Based Tasks
Use NumPy to find the standard deviation of the age column.

Normalize the Fare column using NumPy.

Replace all NaN values in the Age column with the median age using NumPy.

ðŸ”¹ Sorting & Indexing
Sort the passengers by fare in descending order.

Set PassengerId as the index.

Select passengers from index 100 to 200.
